## What I Built

I built **ZK-VCR (Verifiable Credential Oracle)**, a decentralized application that pioneers a new standard for privacy in on-chain transactions. It allows users to prove they meet specific health criteria (like having a low cardiovascular risk score) to a smart contract without ever revealing their underlying personal health information.

The project solves the "Leaky Bucket" problem of modern data privacy, where users are forced to hand over sensitive data to multiple services, risking exposure with every new interaction. ZK-VCR replaces this with an "Airlock" model, built on the philosophy of **Privacy for the User, Transparency for the Algorithm, and Governance for the Source.** A user's data never leaves their device; instead, a Zero-Knowledge proof is generated locally and sent to the chain for verification.
